# Message-ENC-DEC

This project is a lightweight and interactive Message Encoder and Decoder built around the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. Designed as a side project, it serves both as a learning tool and a simple visualization of how substitution-based cryptography works.

The application allows users to encode or decode any text by shifting characters through the alphabet. It visually demonstrates how each letter is transformed, making the encryption process easier to understand for beginners. This project is ideal for students, hobbyists, and anyone curious about basic cryptography.
